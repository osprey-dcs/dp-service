  # out of memory issues in the service.  Limit applies to tabular export formats like csv and xlsx because a large
  # table data structure is created in memory before writing the file, but does not apply to bucketed export formats
  # like hdf5, because each bucket is written to file as it is accessed from the database without building
  # in-memory data strcutures.
