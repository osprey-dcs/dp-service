"""Check doc/release-notes/rel-X.Y.Z.md and the NEXT.md draft: their links, their placeholders, and the
tag-bearing parts of their verification instructions.

One script, copied verbatim into each of the five osprey-dcs repos (dp-grpc, dp-service, dp-desktop-app,
dp-python-lib, data-platform).  The copies differ ONLY in the "REPO-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION" block below.  The rules
are osprey-dcs/data-platform#98.  The self-test exercises every rule, including identity rules a given copy does
not enable, so a copy whose rules have stopped matching fails on its first run.

A notes file is published verbatim as its GitHub release body (here via release.yml's `body_path`;
plan/tickets/56/plan.md), so whatever the file says is what readers of the release page get.  GitHub does not
resolve relative links in a release body, a link pinned to `main` drifts as the repo moves on, and a link copied
from the previous release's notes resolves to real but stale content.  None of that looks wrong in a diff or a
local preview, which is why it is checked rather than left to review.

LINK RULES.  Code spans and fenced code blocks are blanked out first, so text that *quotes* a bad link does not
fail; R5 runs on the raw text, because the placeholders it catches live in code blocks.  A link is an inline
`[text](target)` or image, a reference definition `[label]: target`, an autolink, or a bare URL.

  rel-X.Y.Z.md
    R1  No relative cross-file links: an inline or reference-definition target that is not http(s):, mailto: or
        `#anchor` fails (`../../README.md`, `doc/x.md`).
    R2  Every github.com/osprey-dcs/<repo>/(blob|tree)/<ref>/... and raw.githubusercontent.com/osprey-dcs/<repo>/
        <ref>/... link, into any of the five repos, has <ref> equal to this file's tag (they release in lockstep).
        Exception: a full 40-character commit SHA, for a target that did not exist at the tag -- a section added
        to the notes after the release, such as rel-1.16.0's README.env link.  A SHA cannot drift; `main`, a short
        SHA, or any other tag still fails.
    R3  For tag-pinned links into this repo, the path exists in the working tree, spelled exactly (GitHub is
        case-sensitive; macOS is not), as a file for blob/raw and a directory for tree.
    R4  For tag-pinned links into this repo's .md files with a `#anchor`, and for same-document `#anchor` links,
        the anchor is a heading slug (or an `<a name>`/`id`) in the target, and that heading is not duplicated
        there.  A duplicated heading is what silently moves an anchor to `-1`.  A duplicate no link points at is
        left alone, since there is nothing for it to move.
    R5  No template placeholder left: `rel-<version>`, `<version>`, `<previous>`.

  NEXT.md (the version-less draft, renamed to rel-<version>.md at the cut)
    N1  As R1.
    N2  Every osprey-dcs blob/tree/raw link uses `main`: a `rel-*` ref here guesses an undecided version, and R2
        requires repointing at the cut anyway.
    N3  R3 and R4 for `main`-pinned links into this repo, against the working tree.  This is the check that fails
        a PR renaming a heading a NEXT.md link points at, in the PR that renames it.
    R5 does not apply to NEXT.md: placeholders belong in a draft.

R3, R4 and N3 run against the working tree, which is the tree being tagged both in CI on the cut PR and in
release.yml at the tag: no git, no tag peeling, no network.  Cross-repo paths and anchors get R2 only, since that
tree is not checked out, and so do SHA-pinned links.  Whether URLs resolve over the network is deliberately not
checked: before the tag is pushed, every correctly pinned link 404s.

WHICH NOTES ARE ALREADY RELEASED.  The rel-*.md with the highest X.Y.Z in its directory is the release being cut
(or, between cuts, the latest one) and gets every rule.  Every other rel-*.md is already released and gets the
form rules only -- R1, R2, R5 and the identity rules -- because it is immutable and pinned to its own tag, and
checking its paths and anchors against today's tree would fail an old file the first time a heading is renamed on
`main`.  This needs only the directory listing, so it works offline and the same way in CI and in release.yml
(which passes just the file being released; the comparison is still against that file's directory).  Accepted
consequences: between cuts, the latest release's links into this repo are checked against the moving tree, so a
rename that breaks one fails its PR; and a patch release of an older line would count as released, which the five
repos' lockstep versioning does not produce.

IDENTITY RULES (rel-X.Y.Z.md only), switched on by the configuration block:

  SIGSTORE_PYTHON_RULES (dp-python-lib)
      A `## Verifying these artifacts` heading; at least one `sigstore verify identity`, each naming the wheel,
      the sdist and SHA256SUMS; every `--cert-identity` exactly this repository's release.yml at this file's tag,
      with the GitHub Actions OIDC issuer; and a `**Full Changelog**:` compare link ending at this file's tag and
      starting at an earlier one (which release came before is not knowable from one file).  For NEXT.md this is
      inverted: a verification heading, a verify command at the start of a line, a `--cert-identity` with a value,
      or a Full Changelog line is an error there, since each names the tag.  Prose naming them is fine.
  COSIGN_IDENTITY_WORKFLOWS (dp-service, dp-desktop-app)
      Every `--certificate-identity` is exactly https://github.com/<repo>/.github/workflows/<one of these>
      @refs/tags/<this file's tag>.
  COSIGN_IMAGE (dp-service)
      Every `<image>:rel-...` reference names this file's tag.
  COSIGN_IDENTITY_REGEXP (dp-grpc)
      Every `--certificate-identity-regexp` is exactly this regexp.  It has no tag in it by design; the check stops
      a later edit from loosening it.
  With any COSIGN_* rule on, every `--certificate-oidc-issuer` must also be the GitHub Actions issuer.

The identity rules earn their keep the same way the link rules do: the verification section is copied from the
previous release, and a stale tag in the identity makes verification reject every genuine artifact.

Runs in CI on every PR over every notes file, and in release.yml on the tagged file as a backstop.  Each run starts
with a self-test that feeds every rule known-bad input it must reject and known-good input it must accept, so a
rule that has quietly stopped matching fails loudly instead of passing everything.

Usage:
    python .dev/tools/check-release-notes.py [FILE ...]

With no arguments, checks every <notes dir>/rel-*.md, and NEXT.md if present.  Stdlib only.  Exits 0 if all pass,
1 otherwise.
